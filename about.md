- Information/updates on my projects
  <!-- * My personal experience of making the transition from psychology (Bachelor's degree) to cognitive science (Master's degree)
- Comments on new or not-so-new concepts/findings from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive science and artificial intelligence -->
